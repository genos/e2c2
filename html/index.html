<h3 align="center">Version 0.02 </h3>The group of rational points on an elliptic curve over a finite fields has proven very useful in cryptography since Koblitz and Miller first suggested its use in the 1980s. Due to the lack of subexponential algorithms for the Discrete Logarithm Problem in this group, elliptic curve cryptography enjoys a level of security comparable to other ElGamal-type systems with much smaller key sizes.<p>
There is some room for improvement, however. Typically the rules for the group operation on an elliptic curve involve a number of special cases: <ul>
<li>
What if one point is the point at infinity? </li>
<li>
What if the two points are the same? </li>
<li>
What if they're inverses of each other? </li>
</ul>
In each of these cases, the need to handle an exception to the typical geometric understanding can lead to implementations giving off more information than intended---leaking information through a "side-channel."<p>
In 2007, Dr. Harold Edwards put forth a new form of elliptic curve; despite his paper not focusing on cryptography, his new normal form has very desirable cryptographic properties: the addition law is <em>unified</em> and <em>complete</em>. In other words, Edwards curves do not leak as much side-channel information as curves in typical Weierstrass (or other) forms. Moreover, in many cases the addition laws involve less operations, making for faster computations. While this is not the case over binary fields, the benefits of the law's completeness make the loss of speed seem negligible. In fact, some authors argue that with specialized hardware the speed difference can be greatly reduced, while the completeness of the binary Edwards curve group law actually makes it faster than Weierstrass implementations that must constantly check for special cases. Add to this the reduced code complexity, and binary Edwards curves look much more promising from an implementation point of view.<p>
This code library consists the second version of a C++ proof-of-concept implementation of Edwards Curves (over both binary fields and fields of odd prime characteristic) and both affine and projective points over them, built using Victor Shoup's NTL. </div>
